Perl6-for-SysAdmin
==================

Some Perl6 scripts for system administrator, like TT2/AnyEvent/Dancer/IO::Capture/LWP/Test::More/Net::OpenSSH in Perl5

Progress
===========

Copy testing files from Template6/MuEvent/Bailador/HTTP::Client/File::Find/IO::Capture::Simple/Test.


TODO
===========

* Perl5 scripts that do same things as Perl6 had done.
* Some base usage examples of Perl6. Maybe like my [Perl5 Tour](http://www.perl-china.com/tour.html)
